INNER JOIN
---------------
An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, 
i.e. the two rows they have in common.

>select * from a INNER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
>select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b;

    a | b
    --+--

    3 | 3
    4 | 4


LEFT OUTER JOIN
---------------- 
With left outer join all of the rows of the left table are included in the joined table.


>select * from a LEFT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
>select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b(+);

    a |  b
    --+-----

    1 | null
    2 | null
    3 |    3
    4 |    4


RIGHT OUTER JOIN
----------------
All the rows of the right table are included on the right outer join. 
This means that the right table that donâ€™t have a column in left table still get displayed.
A right outer join will give all rows in B, plus any common rows in A.

>select * from a RIGHT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
>select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a(+) = b.b;

    a    |  b
    -----+----
    3    |  3
    4    |  4
    null |  5
    null |  6
