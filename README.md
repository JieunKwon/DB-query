INNER JOIN
---------------



LEFT OUTER JOIN
---------------- 
With left outer join all of the rows of the left table are included in the joined table.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN
----------------
All the rows of the right table are included on the right outer join. This means that the right table that donâ€™t have a column in left table still get displayed.
